Classfication Models: Ideas from WESAD DATASET

Steps: 
1, Run dataPreprocessing.ipynb
  - change the saving and reading file paths.
  - can choose which variable to filter
2, Run the feature_extractor.ipynb
  - if you want to use the .py to run it, you have to add two more lines at the bottom (initialize the autoencoder and call the extract function)
3, Then run the MLP model.
  - SVM and MLP models are quite similar in the setting. They just use different library to run the code.
4, You can run CNN classifier directly without feature extraction.ipynb.
